- **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed for different site types

## üìä **Expected Results**

With these new sources, the scout function should now discover:

- **More Diverse Content**: Scientific research, platform-specific news, enterprise tech
- **Higher Quality**: Community-curated content from Reddit and Lobste.rs
- **Better Coverage**: Broader range of technology topics and perspectives
- **Research Focus**: Academic and research-based technology content

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limiting Considerations**

- **Reddit**: Respects rate limits by using official API
- **Lobste.rs**: Uses API endpoint to avoid overwhelming the site
- **Scientific Sites**: May have stricter rate limits, consider increasing delays
- **Enterprise Sites**: May have corporate firewalls or rate limiting

## üîç **Monitoring Recommendations**

- Watch for rate limiting errors from new sources
- Monitor success rates for different source types
- Adjust delays if needed for specific sites
- Check for changes in API endpoints or site structures

## üìà **Performance Impact**

- **Increased Discovery**: More sources = more potential articles
- **Better Batching**: New sources may have different URL densities
- **API Reliability**: Reddit and Lobste.rs should be more reliable than HTML scraping
- **Content Diversity**: Wider range of topics and perspectives
