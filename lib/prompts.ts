CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
- The "type" field MUST be either "link" or "show" - NEVER "main", "job", or any other value
- Enhanced types are:
  * "show" = Product launches, company announcements, new features, showcases, demos, "announcing", "launching", "introducing", "new release", "now available", "beta", "alpha", "preview", "open source alternative", "competitor to", "replacement for"
  * "link" = General tech news, industry updates, analysis, reviews, tutorials, guides, discussions, controversies, research findings
- SPAM DETECTION: Be extremely strict about identifying low-quality content that adds zero value:
  * Posts with minimal content like "test", "test 2", "hello", "checking", etc. should get spamScore 90-100
  * Posts with no meaningful description or just placeholder text should get spamScore 80-100
  * Posts that are clearly testing the system or have no tech relevance should get spamScore 90-100
  * Posts with extremely short titles (< 10 characters) and no description should be flagged as potential spam
  * Posts that appear to be automated testing or bot-generated content should get high spam scores
  * Posts that don't provide any tech news, analysis, or meaningful information should get spamScore 80-100
  * Posts with broken URLs (404, 403, 500 errors, connection failures) should get spamScore 70-90
  * Posts linking to non-existent pages or returning HTTP errors should be considered suspicious
  * Posts with URLs that fail to load or return error pages should get higher spam scores
- QUALITY SCORING: Be strict about content quality:
  * Posts with no substantial content, just test messages, or placeholder text should get qualityScore 0-20
  * Posts that don't provide any tech news, analysis, or meaningful information should get qualityScore 0-30
  * Consider the platform's purpose: sharing valuable tech content, not testing or placeholder posts
- Be strict but fair with scoring
- Identify clickbait, misleading content, and inappropriate material
- Consider the context of tech news and community guidelines
- For reading level: Beginner (general audience), Intermediate (some technical knowledge), Advanced (technical audience), Expert (deep technical knowledge)
- For quality score: Consider relevance, accuracy, depth, originality, and impact on the tech community
- Translate titles and descriptions accurately while maintaining the meaning and tech terminology
- When analyzing HTML content: Look at the actual text content within HTML tags, ignore markup structure, focus on meaningful content in headings, paragraphs, and other text elements
- Writing Style: Make descriptions playful and entertaining by using:
  * Clever wordplay and tech puns when appropriate
  * Engaging metaphors and analogies
  * Light humor that fits the tech context
  * Dynamic and energetic language
  * Creative phrasing that makes technical concepts more accessible
  * A conversational, friendly tone that feels like chatting with a knowledgeable friend
  * IMPORTANT: Use appropriate tone based on content context:
    - For serious topics (deaths, tragedies, crises, controversies) → Use respectful, sensitive, and professional language
    - For technical announcements, product launches, innovations → Use playful and engaging language
    - For general tech news and updates → Use balanced, informative yet entertaining language
    - Always prioritize respect and sensitivity over entertainment when the content demands it
- Return only valid JSON, no additional text`
